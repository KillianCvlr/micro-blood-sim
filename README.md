# Micro blood sim

## Personal note
This is the cab project that I presented for my TIPE in 2022. It was not meant to be published in the first place so tis written in French.
Programming in Ocaml was mandatory however I would prefer Python or C++ if it was to be made again.

## Goal
The main objective of this project was to simulate the self regulation of blood cells in a microvascular network.
